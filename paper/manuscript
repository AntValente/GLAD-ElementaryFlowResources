Option 1) Main result: the bidirectional mapping between EI-EF-FEDEFL-IDEA 

Introduction
(GLAD contextualization)
Needs for LCA practitioners, industry, and policymakers:
data centralization and accessibility
facilitating interoperability of common data exchange formats
(GLAD nomenclature WG contextualization)
Aims: development of a system to map lists of elementary flows od LCA databases; bidirectional mapping between widely used nomenclature lists
(Scientific background)
	JRC work (submitted to IJLCA)
	Edelen et al., (Critical review of elementary flows in LCA data, IJLCA 2017)
Materials and methods
Common format and file structure 
Features of the mapper tool
Transparent documentation (match rating and mapping hierarchy)
Iterations and checks structure (reverse mapping)
Sensitivity
Results and Discussion
Coverages
	Breakdown (e.g., use of proxies)
(other analyses)
Known issues (discussion: how to deal with them)
Result of the sensitivity
Conclusions and outlook
-How to overcome the known issues
-No perfect mapping->A common backbone as an ambition
-Potential extension to other nomenclature systems (LCIA methods and native software).
- This work paves the way towards a common central hub common list for mapping (identification of best candidates as the starting point based on to coverages and other aspects)




Option 2) 
Main result: Framework to map between nomenclature systems
(Framework application: bidirectional mapping between EI-EF-FEDEFL-IDEA)
Introduction
(GLAD and nomenclature WG contextualization)
Needs for LCA practitioners, industry, and policymakers:
