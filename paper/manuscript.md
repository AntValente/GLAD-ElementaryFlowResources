Helpful tools
* when using a bibliography add to bibliography.bib document and then cite in paper using this format [@edelen_critical_2018]. [@""] the text in the quotes will appear on the first row in the .bib document and can be copied and pasted into the paper.
* When using tables you can create in excel and then copy and paste into an issue. When you past into the issue text box it will automatically format the table into the appropriate code. You can then copy and paste from the issue text box into the paper. At the end of the table add a table reference {tbl:"tablename"}
* When referencing a table use the format[{tbl:"tablename"}]

# Option 1) Main result: the bidirectional mapping between EI-EF-FEDEFL-IDEA 

## Introduction
(GLAD contextualization)
## Needs for LCA practitioners, industry, and policymakers:
data centralization and accessibility
facilitating interoperability of common data exchange formats
(GLAD nomenclature WG contextualization)
## Aims: development of a system to map lists of elementary flows od LCA databases; bidirectional mapping between widely used nomenclature lists
(Scientific background)
	JRC work (submitted to IJLCA)
	Edelen et al., (Critical review of elementary flows in LCA data, IJLCA 2017)
## Materials and methods
## Common format and file structure 
## Features of the mapper tool
## Transparent documentation (match rating and mapping hierarchy)
## Iterations and checks structure (reverse mapping)
## Sensitivity
## Results and Discussion
## Coverages
	Breakdown (e.g., use of proxies)
(other analyses)
## Known issues (discussion: how to deal with them)
## Result of the sensitivity
## Conclusions and outlook
-How to overcome the known issues
-No perfect mapping->A common backbone as an ambition
-Potential extension to other nomenclature systems (LCIA methods and native software).
- This work paves the way towards a common central hub common list for mapping (identification of best candidates as the starting point based on to coverages and other aspects)




# Option 2) Main result: Framework to map between nomenclature systems
(Framework application: bidirectional mapping between EI-EF-FEDEFL-IDEA)
## Introduction
(GLAD and nomenclature WG contextualization)
## Needs for LCA practitioners, industry, and policymakers:
    - data centralization and accessibility
    - facilitating interoperability of common data exchange formats
## Puropse
-	development of a framework to map lists of elementary flows of LCA databases; 
-	Prove the applicability of the method: bidirectional mapping between widely used nomenclature lists

## History of previous efforts
 -JRC work (submitted to IJLCA)
 -Edelen et al., (Critical review of elementary flows in LCA data, IJLCA 2017)
## Materials and methods
## Native flowlists structure
  -Each flowlist provide a short introduction to structure and then point to individual guidance documentation
  ## Methods
 	Present improvements to structure via use of classification systems and addition of CAS numbers
	Flow list management techniques that have changed (github)
		Version control
		Public accessibility
## Interoperability (?)
	Highlight the difference between single source development and a collaborative effort (pros and cons)
	Highlight difference between nomenclature issues and methodological issues and how sometimes they are a blend based on how the native flowlist is structured

## Results and Discussion
### Common format and file structure 
### Features of the mapper tool
### Transparent documentation (match rating and mapping hierarchy)
	May appear in mapping file, but will not impact the mapping itself
### Iterations and checks structure (reverse mapping)
### Case study (GLAD nomenclature systems)
### Coverages
	Breakdown (e.g., use of proxies)
(other analyses)
### Known issues (discussion: how to deal with them)
## Conclusions and outlook
-How to overcome the known issues
-No perfect mapping->A common backbone as an ambition
-Potential extension to other nomenclature systems (LCIA methods and native software).
- This work paves the way towards a common central hub common list for mapping (identification of best candidates as the starting point based on to coverages and other aspects)
