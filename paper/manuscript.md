# Option 1) Main result: the bidirectional mapping between EI-EF-FEDEFL-IDEA 

## Introduction
(GLAD contextualization)
## Needs for LCA practitioners, industry, and policymakers:
data centralization and accessibility
facilitating interoperability of common data exchange formats
(GLAD nomenclature WG contextualization)
## Aims: development of a system to map lists of elementary flows od LCA databases; bidirectional mapping between widely used nomenclature lists
(Scientific background)
	JRC work (submitted to IJLCA)
	Edelen et al., (Critical review of elementary flows in LCA data, IJLCA 2017)
## Materials and methods
## Common format and file structure 
## Features of the mapper tool
## Transparent documentation (match rating and mapping hierarchy)
## Iterations and checks structure (reverse mapping)
## Sensitivity
## Results and Discussion
## Coverages
	Breakdown (e.g., use of proxies)
(other analyses)
## Known issues (discussion: how to deal with them)
## Result of the sensitivity
## Conclusions and outlook
-How to overcome the known issues
-No perfect mapping->A common backbone as an ambition
-Potential extension to other nomenclature systems (LCIA methods and native software).
- This work paves the way towards a common central hub common list for mapping (identification of best candidates as the starting point based on to coverages and other aspects)




# Option 2) Main result: Framework to map between nomenclature systems
(Framework application: bidirectional mapping between EI-EF-FEDEFL-IDEA)
## Introduction
(GLAD and nomenclature WG contextualization)
## Needs for LCA practitioners, industry, and policymakers:
    - data centralization and accessibility
    - facilitating interoperability of common data exchange formats
## Puropse
-	development of a framework to map lists of elementary flows of LCA databases; 
-	Prove the applicability of the method: bidirectional mapping between widely used nomenclature lists
## Interoperability
- challenges to overcome
## Scientific background
