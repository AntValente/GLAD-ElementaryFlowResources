# GLAD mapping files 

The mapping file folder is organized to include two components of the mappings. The folder contains the subfolder inputs that includes the input files for the JRC mapping tool and the finalized output mapping files. Users should note that the JRC mapping output files require additional manual edits in order to reflect the finalized output mapping files stored in this folder.
