# GLAD mapping files 

The mapping file folder is organized to include two components of the mappings. The folder inputs contains the original source flow lists in the mapping template and the input files for the JRC mapping tool. Users should be aware that the JRC mapping tool requires additional information and inputs to create the finalized output files.
